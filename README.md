# LINE-wrapper
This is a basic Electron wrapper for the LINE web app. This is NOT an official LY product, it simply uses Electron to present the LINE web application as if it were its own dedicated application (like [LINE Desktop](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpfcc4cd725961?hl=en-US&gl=US), but for Linux or situations where the official app doesn't work on Windows). Use at your own risk.

Clone this repo and use run-windows.ps1/run-linux.sh to start the requirements install by npm and then run the Electron wrapper. You should now be able to sign into LINE and start using it.
